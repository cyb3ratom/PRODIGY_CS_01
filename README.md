# Caesar Cipher – Python Implementation

This project is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm, which is one of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

Example (Shift = 3):

- Plaintext: `HELLO`
- Ciphertext: `KHOOR`

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts text using a shift value
- Decrypts text using a shift value
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabet characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user inputs a message.
2. The user chooses a shift value (e.g., 3).
3. The user selects a mode: encryption or decryption.
4. The program shifts each letter accordingly.

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caesar-cipher.git
cd caesar-cipher
